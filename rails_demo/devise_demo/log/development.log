[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/sign_in".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:
